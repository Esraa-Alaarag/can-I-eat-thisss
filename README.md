# Project 3 (name TBD) - Group: Esraa, Francheska, Naomi
-----------------------

An app for people who care about the ingredients they're buying! Quickly and easily take a picture of the ingredient list or barcode of a product such as shampoo, energy bar, baby food, soap, chap stick, cookie, or pretty much anything, and the app will give you more information about each ingredient from that long and hard to read list of ingredients.

If you have any kind of allergies, dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free, vegetarian, lactose-intolerant, or cultural preferences such as Halal or Kosher you can easily log in, build a user profile, and save your unique preferences.

## User Stories
------------

- As a user, I want to quickly and easily take a picture of the info section of a product and immediately see if the product contains any ingredients I don't want to buy. 

- As a user, I want to 'red flag' ingredients I am careful about. Such as items I am allergic to examples include: peanuts, gluten, dairy, etc. and/or culturally/religiously specific items examples include: Halal, Kosher, vegetarian, etc..

- As a user, I want to login to my account where I can save my unique preferences and ingredient list in a user profile.

- As a user, I want to be able to edit/update/delete my saved product ingredients on my user profile.
