## App description

An app for people who care about the ingredients they're buying! Quickly and easily take a picture of the ingredient list or barcode of a product such as cereal, snacks, or pretty much anything, and the app will give you more information about each ingredient from that long and hard to read list of ingredients.

If you have a kind of allergies or dietary restrictions, you can select your issues from profile, and save your unique preferences.

-	Allergens

	-	Peanut
	-	Tree Nuts
	-	Milk
	-	Egg
	-	Wheat
	-	Soy
	-	Fish
	-	Shellfish
	-	Sesame

This APP gets the product's ingredient and search it for more than 60 keywords to tell the user if this product is for him/her.

This APP has an external database to store product information and Users' Issues.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to use the app in the mobile and/or browser.

- As a user I want to know if I'm using wrong number of digits or letters by mistake.

- As a user, I want to add and edit the ingredients I am careful about in the User Profile.

- As a user, I want to quickly and easily take a picture of the product's barcode , and immediately see if the product contains any ingredients I don't want to buy. 

- As a user, I want the option to write the barcode (maybe is the user's preferred way for security reasons, or camera doesn't work, etc), and immediately see if the product contains any ingredients I don't want to buy.

- As a user, I want to 'red flag' ingredients I am careful about. Such as items I am allergic to examples include: peanuts, gluten, dairy, etc. 

- As a user, I want a history of all the products I already look up, and be able to delete it.
- As a user I want to see the product picture if avaliable and see the ingredients.
